# Output Folder

The output folder is where you save new datasets, figures, and possibly text in projects where it is generated. 

### Organization

This is very flexible and project dependent. To start, I might organize files in the following hierarchy: 
  
  1. Type
  2. Product
  3. Any sub-product series
  4. etc...

### Included Examples

I've made folders for three common types of files I might want to save during an analysis project:

* **data**: This folder would contain files like .csv, .json, .tsv, or .xlsx.
* **figures**: This folder would contain files like .png, .jpg, or .svg. 
* **text**: This folder would contain files like .pdf.
