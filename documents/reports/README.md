# Documents - Reports

There are two suggested folders.

* **drafts**: Any drafts of reports, or even building blocks. This might end up messy, but that's ok.
* **published**: The actual final documents. Feel free to use final2-seriously-this-is-it.doc in the drafts folder, but this is the clean folder.
