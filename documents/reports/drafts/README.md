# Drafts Folder

I've included example folders for 3 common sections of a larger report. Developing them independently is an option that makes it easy to lift work for other projects. Report drafts can be saved directly in the Drafts folder, or perhaps create more folders if the project requires multiple reports.

* **review**: This folder would contain observations and summaries of previously published works.
* **methodology**: This folder would contain formal descriptions of methodology used in the project.
* **findings**: This folder would contain explanations of the findings of the project.
