# Documents Folder

This folder should organize any written communications involved with the project. I suggest seperating different parts of the process, but customize as necessary.

### Examples

I've prepared folders for four common parts of a data analysis writeup.

* **review**: This folder would contain observations and summaries of previously published works. I encourage you to treat it as a staging area to prepare the review section of a larger work.
* **methodology**: This folder would contain formal descriptions of methodology used in the project. I encourage you to treat it as a staging area to prepare the methodology section of a larger work, but don't let this stop you from code commenting and documenting the methodology elsewhere in the project repository.
* **findings**: This folder would contain explanations of the findings of the project. I encourage you to treat it as a staging area to prepare the findings section of a larger work.
* [**reports**](reports/README): This folder contains unified reports, hopefully using materials from other folders in the documents directory. If you're copy-pasting from those other documents, you're doing it right.
