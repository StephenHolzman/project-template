# Documents Folder

This folder should organize any written communications involved with the project.

### Examples

I've prepared folders for three common parts of a data analysis project.

* [**reports**](reports/README.md): This folder contains unified reports, hopefully using materials from other folders in the documents directory. If you're copy-pasting from those other documents, you're doing it right.
* **meetings**: If this is a collaborative project and notes are being taken, keep them here.
* **feedback**: If the project involves feedback from outside groups, keep notes here.
