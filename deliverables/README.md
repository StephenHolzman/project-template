# Deliverables Folder

This folder should document contact with a client and is likely a combination of things from the rest of the project. I suggest creating a folder for each date materials were sent to the client, with a copy of the materials as they were sent in that folder.

Names should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD-description

Examples names might be:

* 2017-02-29-proposal
* 2017-03-14-progress-report
* 2017-04-17-report-draft-1
* 2017-06-02-report-final
