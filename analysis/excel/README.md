# Excel Guidelines

Excel is a wonderful tool that makes quick exploration and analysis of data possible. You can share your data and analysis by just sending one file, and practically every computer in a work environment has Excel installed. The same properties that make Excel easy for unsophisticated sharing make it difficult for maintaining sophisticated analysis.

* Excel's cell based workflow does not require strict seperation of data and logic.
* Reading data from excel workbooks into other programs is arduous.
* Reading a programming script is naturally top to bottom. Excel requires reverse engineering a web of connected cells.
* Excel logic is not easily ported to other projects.

If working with downloaded excel workbook data, start with a copy from the input folder and keep those sheets in the workbook unaltered while working in new sheets for the analysis.

My advice is to keep excel use to the exploratory workspace folder. If excel is part of the main analysis, be sure to keep very good notes!
