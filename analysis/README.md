# Analysis Folder

These are the scripts and files that contain the math and processing done for a project, essentially the code folder. Any previously published data should be read in from the "input" folder. Data created for this project should be written and read to the "output" folder.

I like keeping my files organized by program type and include a few example folders.

* [**R**](R/README.md) R scripts would go here.
* [**stata**](stata/README.md) Stata scripts would go here.
* [**excel**](excel/README.md) Excel workbooks would go here.
