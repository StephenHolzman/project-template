# Stata Example Folder

When working in Stata or other closed-source statistical packages, do everything possible to save datasets to the output folder in agnostic file formats like .csv, .tsv, or .json so that other programs can work with them without the need to translate. Stata, SAS, and SPSS have no problem working with them either.
